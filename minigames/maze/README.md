# Educational Maze Minigame

## Core Game Structure
1. **3D Maze Environment**: A first-person view where players navigate through corridors
2. **Checkpoint System**: Math problems appear at intersections or doors
3. **Progress Mechanics**: Solving problems correctly unlocks new paths

### Implementation Approach

For the 3D environment, choose one of the following options:
- **Unity**: Good choice for cross-platform compatibility and extensive 3D tools
- **Three.js**: Ideal for a web-based solution that doesn't require installation
- **Unreal Engine**: For more photorealistic graphics (might be overkill)

For the math problem component:
- Create a problem generator with adjustable difficulty levels
- Design a clean UI overlay that appears when players reach checkpoints
- Implement a scoring system that rewards speed and accuracy

## Later Features:

### Power-ups
For streaks of correct answers:
- Temporary speed boosts
- Map reveals (showing a portion of the maze layout)
- Hint tokens for difficult problems
- Skip tokens for particularly challenging questions

## Custom Flashcard Integration
- Allow CSV/spreadsheet uploads with question/answer pairs
- Create a simple editor for users to make their own problems
- Support image uploads for visual learning problems
