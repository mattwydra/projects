## Code Explanation

### HTML
The HTML file defines the layout and elements for:
- `#progress-bar`: Visual timer for the memorization phase.
- `#sequence`: Displays the sequence for players to memorize.
- `#correct-text`, `#incorrect-text`: Feedback messages for success or failure.
- Buttons for game control (`#start-timer`, `#proceed-button`, `#reset-button`, `#save-btn`).

### JavaScript
The JavaScript file contains the game logic:

#### Sequence Generation
- Generates a random sequence of digits (0-9) based on the current sequence length.
- Converts the sequence to a string for display.

#### Display Logic
- Displays the sequence and hides it after the memorization timer ends.
- Dynamically updates the progress bar width during the timer.

#### User Input Handling
- Prompts the player to input the memorized sequence.
- Compares the input with the generated sequence to determine success or failure.

#### Game State Management
- Tracks variables like the sequence, user input, current score, and starting sequence length.
- Provides reset functionality to restart the game from the default state.

#### High Score Management
- Stores the highest score in `localStorage`.
- Updates the display and provides alerts based on performance.

## Future Features

2. **Lightning Mode**:
   - Reduces memorization time for an added challenge.

3. **Custom Starting Length**:
   - Allows players to choose a starting sequence length (1-5 or higher).

4. **Enhanced Timer Options**:
   - Add a configurable timer length to cater to different difficulty preferences.
