Timer:

    Timer that displays the amount of time remaining for memorization

High Score Tracking:

    Store the highest number that was memorized

Gameplay:

    Allow for reverse memorization 
	- This would require the user to input the given string of numbers backwards

    Lightning mode
	- Half the time (or something similar)

    Custom starting length
	- Strings of length 1-5 are quite easy to memorize. Hence, the game starts at 6 by default
	- Future functionality would start at 1, with the option to start higher if the user chooses
