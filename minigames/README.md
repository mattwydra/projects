# Mini-Games Collection

This repository houses a series of small, interactive web-based games created for the purpose of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's pretty informal, so some of the features might follow that aesthetic. I plan to create a more professional repository that will be linked on my resume, but this is the more casual and fun implementation, including some information about who I am and what I enjoy doing in my free time!

## How to play:
Click on [this link](https://mattwydra.github.io/projects/) and select the game you would like to try out! Detailed feature-lists for each game is below.

### Note  
This repository is a work in progress. Some features may not work as intended, and bugs are to be expected. Feedback is always welcome!
