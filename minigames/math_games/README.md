## How to Add or Modify Content  

1. **Edit Text Files**:  
   - Each text file corresponds to a specific game mode. Simply add, remove, or edit entries as needed.  
   - Ensure each entry is on a new line for proper parsing in the game.

2. **Formatting Tips**:  
   - For special characters, include a variety of symbols, ensuring diversity.  
   - For jargon and uncommon words, avoid duplicates and maintain relevancy.  
   - For numbers, include a mix of short and long sequences, as well as formatted numbers (e.g., `1,234` or `3.14`).
