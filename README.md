# Mini-Games Collection

This repository houses a series of small, interactive web-based games created for the purpose of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's pretty informal, so some of the features might follow that aesthetic. I plan to create a more professional repository that will be linked on my resume, but this is the more casual and fun implementation, including some information about who I am and what I enjoy doing in my free time!
