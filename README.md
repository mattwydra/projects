# Personal Projects Collection  

This repository is a hub for my personal projects, showcasing various creative and technical endeavors, including web-based mini-games, Discord bots, productivity tools, and more. It's an evolving space where I explore new ideas, experiment with technologies, and build fun, useful, and sometimes quirky applications.  

While originally focused on mini-games for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this repository has grown to include projects from other areas, such as bots, utilities, and tools aimed at improving productivity and fostering creativity (coming soon).  

## How to Explore  
Each project has its own folder with a dedicated README (where applicable) to explain its purpose, features, and usage instructions. Find the link to access the minigames hub below!

### Note  
This repository is a work in progress. Some features may not work as intended, and bugs are to be expected. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

### **Discord Bot: Hopecore**  
A bot designed to spread positivity and motivation, featuring custom daily reminders and image-based responses.  
- Randomized motivational quotes and images.  
- Special modes for 'daily reminders' using unique assets.
- I created a [demo](https://mattwydra.github.io/projects/discord_bots/hopecore_v1/browser_demo/index.html) that mimics the bot's behavior. Although the demo is web-based, the bot operates similarly (creating a quote/image pair and returning it to the user).

### **Planned Projects**  
- **To-Do List & Calendar Reminder App**: A tool for managing events, tasks, and reminders, complete with motivational elements.  
- **More Mini-Games**: Expanding the game library with innovative ideas and enhanced features for existing games.  
- **More Bots**: Including productivity-focused, motivation-focused, and entertainment-based bots for platforms like Discord.
  - This also will include future Discord integration, where all the minigames will be runnable inside of the Discord UI
- **Database-Driven Applications**: Exploring databases for persistent storage, starting with highscore management.  
- **Experimental Tools**: Ideas that might emerge as I continue experimenting and learning.  

## Upcoming Features  
- User dashboards for tracking progress (e.g., highscores or task completion).  
- ~~Light/Dark mode support across all projects.~~
- Integration of sound effects and music for a more immersive experience.  
- Improved accessibility features like colorblind modes and keyboard-only navigation.
- Better mobile support for minigames
- Home button to return to home page

## About Me  
This repository is a reflection of my journey as a developer and a creator. It blends my interests in coding, productivity, and gaming into a playful yet purposeful collection. Some projects lean toward the informal and fun side, while others aim to be polished and professional. I strive to strike a balance between learning, creating, and sharing what Iâ€™ve built with others.
