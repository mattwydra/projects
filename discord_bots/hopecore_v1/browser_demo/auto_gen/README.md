# Full README coming soon

The purpose of this is actually to create a page that can be referenced as a browser source for the background of livestreams. 

## Steps:
Add browser source
Copy this link: https://mattwydra.github.io/projects/discord_bots/hopecore_v1/browser_demo/auto_gen/index.html
Paste the URL into the browser source UI
Click refresh cache just in case (maybe spam it a few times; that's what worked for me)

### Issues:
Rate-limiting

### Potential fixes
Pre-load quotes + images
Host my own server
Disable auto-refresh in SLOBS
