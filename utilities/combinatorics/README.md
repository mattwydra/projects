# Combinatorics

1. All the calculation functions for the different combinatorial formulas
2. The full implementation of the `calculate()` function that was cut off
3. Error handling for invalid inputs
4. Additional helper functions for more advanced combinatorial calculations

The calculator now supports all the requested features, including:
- Basic counting principles tab
- Permutations and combinations tab with various formulas
- Advanced concepts tab including Binomial Theorem, Pigeonhole Principle, etc.
- Interactive explanation sections for each formula
- Clean, responsive styling

When a user selects a calculation type, they'll see an explanation of the formula, its use cases, and examples to help them understand when and how to apply it. The calculator handles various edge cases and provides meaningful error messages when invalid inputs are provided.

The tabbed interface makes it easy to navigate between the calculator itself and educational content about combinatorial principles. This makes your calculator not just a tool but also a learning resource.
